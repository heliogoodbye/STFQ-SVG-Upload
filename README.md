# STFQ-SVG-Upload
**STFQ SVG Upload** extends the functionality of the WordPress media library by enabling users to upload SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files securely. With SVG becoming increasingly popular for web graphics due to its scalability and flexibility, this plugin ensures that WordPress users can incorporate SVG images into their websites without compromising security.

Key Features:

4. **Script Tag Removal**: Removes all `<script>` elements from the SVG content, preventing the execution of any embedded scripts and enhancing website security.

5. **Customizable**: Offers flexibility for developers to customize the sanitization process based on specific security requirements or preferences.

By incorporating the "STFQ SVG Upload" plugin into their WordPress websites, users can leverage the power of SVG graphics while maintaining robust security measures. The plugin ensures that SVG files are sanitized upon upload, safeguarding websites from potential security vulnerabilities associated with SVG content.
